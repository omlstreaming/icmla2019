# ICMLA2019 - Streaming PCA: Towards Guarantees for Low-latency High-throughput Processing
This repository contains the source code for the ICMLA2019 paper Streaming PCA: Towards Guarantees for Low-latency High-throughput Processing.

The code is available for review only, as it needs considerable infrastructure work to run the benchmarks without completing the necessary configuration steps. 
However, we believe it should be sufficient to have a glimpse of the processes executed and therefore interpret the performance results presented in the paper.
