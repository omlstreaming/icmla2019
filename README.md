# ICMLA2019 - Dimensionality Reduction for Low-latency High-throughput Fraud Detection on Datastreams
This repository contains the source code for the ICMLA2019 paper Dimensionality Reduction for Low-latency High-throughput Fraud Detection on Datastreams.

The code is available for review only, as it needs considerable infrastructure work to run the benchmarks without completing the necessary configuration steps. 
However, we believe it should be sufficient to have a glimpse of the processes executed and therefore interpret the performance results presented in the paper.
